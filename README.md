##### Summary

Aloha Apparel Co was a great way to get a taste of hand coding a website homepage in css3 and html5 mark up. I learned about adding multiple class selectors to a div. Using font awesome for social media icons was fun. Building the newsletter sign up form was also an excellent learning experience.
